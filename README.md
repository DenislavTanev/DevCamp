The website is part of a major project, and it will consist 2 parts(**DevCamp** and **DevLearn**).Each of two parts is a **Multipage** listing platform.The **Goal** is to create cool and interactive Ecosystem for developers and clients.

## :pencil2: Overview

**DevCamp** is a website where anyone can become seller and share their talent. Sellers can create **Gigs** for the services that they offer and they can add their own or apply to job posts(Short contracts). Clients can buy projects(**Gigs**) from **Freelancers** and post a job request. To become a seller you need to fill your personal information.   

**DevLearn** is a course platform where only approved experts can create courses. The main purpose of this platform is to help anyone become a freelancer or just expand their knowledge. Any purchased course is accessible forever.
